            This add-in demonstrates the creation of a simple electric distribution report.  It traces downstream from a given point and adds up the count of customers and total load per phase.  This sample
            is meant to be a demonstration on how to use the Utility Network portions of the SDK.  The report display is rudimentary.  Look elsewhere in the SDK for better examples on how to display data.
            
            Rather than coding special logic to pick a starting point, this sample leverages the existing Set Trace Locations tool that is included with the product.
            That tool writes rows to a table called UN_Temp_Starting_Points, which is stored in the default project workspace.  This sample reads rows from that table and uses them as starting points
            for our downstream trace.

            Instructions for use
            1. Select a utility network layer or a feature layer that participates in a utility network
            2. Click on the SDK Samples tab on the Utility Network tab group
            3. Click on the Starting Points tool to create a starting point on the map
            4. Click on the Create Load Report tool

            This is the implementation of our button.  We pass the selected layer to GenerateReport() which does the bulk of the work.
            We then display the results, along with error messages, in a MessageBox.

            GetStartingPointRow
            
            This routine opens up the starting points table and tries to read a row.  This table is created in 
            the default project workspace when the user first creates a starting point.
            
            If the table doesn't exist or is empty, we add an error to our results object a null row.
            If the table contains one row, we just return the row
            If the table contains more than one row, we return the first row, and log a warning message
            	(this tool only works with one starting point)

            Utility network SDK samples require a utility network service to run.  For the Load Report sample, you will need to do the following: 
            * Configure a utility network database and service using the ArcGIS for Electric data model.  Instructions for setting up and configuring this data are located on the [ArcGIS for Electric website](http://solutions.arcgis.com/electric/help/electric-utility-network-configuration/). 
            * Run the ConfigureLoadReportData.py python script to complete the configuration for this sample.
            Of course, the constants inside the source files can be changed to accommodate different data models.
