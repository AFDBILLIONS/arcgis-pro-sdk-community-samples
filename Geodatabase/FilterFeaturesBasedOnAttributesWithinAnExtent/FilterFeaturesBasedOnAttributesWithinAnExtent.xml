            1. Download the Community Sample data (see under the 'Resources' section for downloading sample data).  The sample data contains required data for this sample add-in.  Make sure that the Sample data is unzipped in c:\data and "C:\Data\Interacting with Maps" is available.
            1. In Visual Studio click the Build menu. Then select Build Solution.
            1. Click Start button to open ArcGIS Pro.
            1. ArcGIS Pro will open. 
            1. Open the "C:\Data\Interacting with Maps\Interacting with Maps.aprx" project which contains the required data needed for this sample.
