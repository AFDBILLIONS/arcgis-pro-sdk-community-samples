            This addin lists all subtypes for a Feature Class and allows deleting all features with a specific subtype

            1. Download the Community Sample data (see under the 'Resources' section for downloading sample data).  The sample data contains required data for this sample add-in.  Make sure that the Sample data is unzipped in c:\data and "C:\Data\Interacting with Maps" is available.
            1. In Visual Studio click the Build menu. Then select Build Solution.
            1. Click Start button to open ArcGIS Pro.
            1. ArcGIS Pro will open.
            1. Open the "C:\Data\Interacting with Maps\Interacting with Maps.aprx" project which contains the required data needed for this sample.
            1. Make sure "Portland Crimes" is the active map and the "Contents" dockpane is open.
            1. Select "Crimes" on the Contents table of content.

            1. Click on the Add-In Tab and note the "Delete All Features Having Subtype" dropdown.
            1. Note that when no Layer is selected in the TOC, clicking on the combobox will show an empty list. An empty list will also be shown if the Layer is not a Feature Layer i.e. if it is a standalone table.
            1. Select the  "Crimes" feature layer because it has a defined subtype. 
            1. Opening the Combobox will list all the subtypes for the FeatureClass.
            ![UI](Screenshots/Screen2.png)
            1. On Selecting a Subtype, all the features with that subtype will be deleted from the FeatureClass and thereby cleared from the Map.
            1. Finally you can use the "Undo" button to restore the subtype data you just deleted.
