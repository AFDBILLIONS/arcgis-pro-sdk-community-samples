            This sample illustrates notifications in the application.  There are two main categories of notifications - toast notifications
            which are transient message to the user that contains relevant, time-sensitive information and provides quick access to related 
            content in an application; these appear in the top right hand corner of the display and last for a few seconds. The second category

            A toast notification is a transient message to the user that contains relevant, time-sensitive  
            information and provides quick access to related content in an application. Notifications appear  
            in the top right hand corner of the display and last for a few seconds unless the mouse pointer  
            is over top them. Up to four notifications can appear at the same time. If more than four notifications  
            are sent, each new notification bumps off the oldest one in the queue.
