             A more complicated annotation construction tool.  Specify a symbol, text string and geometry for the annotation feature rather than using the default template attributes.

             <remarks>
             Annotation construction tools work as per other construction tools.  Set the categoryRefID in the daml file to be "esri_editing_construction_annotation".
             <para></para>
             Annotation feature classes store polygon geometry.  This polygon is the bounding box of the text of an annotation feature. The bounding box 
             is calculated from the text string, font, font size, angle orientation and other text formatting attributes of the feature. It is automatically 
             updated by the application each time the annotation attributes are modified. You should never need to access or modify an annotation features 
             polygon shape.  
             <para></para>
             The text attributes of an annotation feature are represented by a CIMTextGraphic. The CIMTextGraphic consists of the text string, text attributes 
             (such as verticalAlignment, horizontalAlignment, fontFamily, fontSize etc), callouts, leader lines and the CIMTextGraphic geometry. This geometry 
             can be a point, straight line, bezier curve or multipoint geometry and represents the baseline geometry that the text string sits upon. 
             <para></para>
             When creating an annotation feature the geometry passed to the Create method is the cimTextGraphic geometry.  
             <para></para>
             <para></para>
             Another annotation consideration is the annotation schema.  The only guaranteed fields to exist are AnnotationClassID, SymbolID, Status, Element, Shape. 
             All other fields (such as textString, FontName,  VerticalAlignment etc) are optional and may not exist in the physical schema. 
            
             If the fields you wish to set exist in the schema then you can use the Create method with the dictionary as illustrated below
             otherwise you should use the Create method using the template and shape parameters (illustrated in AnnoSimpleConstructionTool.cs)
            
             At 2.1 there is currently no way in the API to preset the textString of a newly created feature if the textString field does not physically exist 
             in the feature class schema.  This is also true for other optional annotation attribute fields.

            The text attributes of an annotation feature are represented as a CIMTextGraphic.The CIMTextGraphic 
            contains the text string, text formatting attributes (such as alignment, angle, font, color, etc), and other information (such as

            <summary>
            This sample illustrates construction tools and modify tools for annotation feature classes.  The modify tools show how to modify the text, geometry and symbol of 
            annotation features.  There are also some tools illustrating how to add callouts and leader lines to annotation features. 
            Annotation has the following special considerations
            1.  Annotation feature classes store polygon geometry.  This polygon is the bounding box of the text of an annotation feature. The 
            bounding box is calculated from the text string, font, font size, angle orientation and other text formatting attributes of the feature. 
            It is automatically updated by the application each time the annotation attributes are modified. You should never need to access or 
            modify an annotation feature's polygon shape.
            2. The text attributes of an annotation feature are represented as a CIMTextGraphic. The CIMTextGraphic 
            contains the text string, text formatting attributes (such as alignment, angle, font, color, etc), and other information (such as callouts 
            and leader lines). It also has a shape which represents the baseline geometry that the annotation text string sits upon. For annotation 
            features this CIMTextGraphic shape can be a point, polyline (typically a two point line or Bezier curve), multipoint or geometryBag. It is 
            this shape that you will typically interact with when developing annotation tools. For example when creating annotation features, the
            geometry passed to the EditOperation.Create method is the CIMTextGraphic geometry.
            3.  In ArcGIS Pro, the only fields guaranteed to exist in an annotation schema are AnnotationClassID, SymbolID, Element, FeatureID, 
            ZOrder and Status along with the system ObjectID and Shape fields. All other fields which store text formatting attributes (such as 
            TextString, FontName, VerticalAlignment, HorizontalAlignment etc) are not guaranteed to exist in the physical schema. This is different 
            from the annotation schema in ArcGIS 10x where all fields existed and were unable to be deleted. In ArcGIS Pro, these text formatting 
            fields are able to be deleted by the user if they exist; they are no longer designated as protected or system fields. If you are writing 
            or porting tools that create or modify annotation features, it is essential to take this important concept into account.
            (See AnnoModifyText and AnnoModifySymbol for examples of how to modify the TextString field when it exists in the schema and when it does not.)
            4. Construction tools - Set the categoryRefID in the daml file to be "esri_editing_construction_annotation".  Also note that the geometry
            being passed to the EditOperation.Crreate method is the CIMTextGraphic geometry.
            5. Editing tools - Use the EditOperation.Callback method in conjunction with a non-recycling cursor via Table.Search and the GetGraphic and 
            SetGraphic methods on the AnnotationFeature class to get and set the CIMTextGraphic of an annotation feature.  (see AnnoModifySymbol.cs).
            The CIMTextGraphic has attributes for settings color, font family, text justification, font size, text sring and the text baseline geometry.
            There is no other way in ArcGIS Pro 2.1) to directly modify the CIMTextSymbol.
