            This sample provides a new tab and controls that allow you to set the time in the map view, step through time, and navigate between time enabled bookmarks in the map.

            <remarks>
            1. In Visual Studio click the Build menu. Then select Build Solution.

            3. ArcGIS Pro will open.

            ![UI](screenshots/UICommands.png)  
            5. Within this tab there are 3 groups that provide functionality to navigate through time.
            6. The Map Time group provides two date picker controls to set the start and end time in the map.
            7. The Time Step group provides two combo boxes to set the time step interval. The previous and next button can be used to offset the map time forward or back by the specified time step interval.
            8. The Bookmarks group provides a gallery of time enabled bookmarks for the map. Clicking a bookmark in the gallery will zoom the map to that location and time. 
            It also provides play, previous and next buttons that can be used to navigate between the time enabled bookmarks. 
            These commands are only enabled when there are at least 2 bookmarks in the map. Finally it provides a slider that can be used to set how quickly to move between bookmarks during playback.
